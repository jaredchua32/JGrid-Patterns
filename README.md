# JGrid

I created JGrid as a CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery learning tool. Originally, JGrid was called FluidGrid. However, I later learned that Bootstrap IS the fluid grid. Because many things can be made by using a simple grid, my goal with sharing JGrid to the world is for people to create amazing applications with it.

## Features

### Dynamic Grid Dimensions

JGrid is a grid whose dimensions the user can define. Because JGrid's 'boxes' are only generated as needed, there is less overhead when it comes to load time and initialization.

The height and width of JGrid's boxes are dynamically calculated in the event that the window or grid's dimensions are modified.

### Extensible Patterns

One of JGrid's main features is the simplicity of creating and modifying existing patterns. Patterns are generated when any box in the grid is clicked. Please see the Creating/Modifying Patterns section for more information.

### Variable Animation Speed

Users have the ability to modify JGrid's animation speed in order to follow the patterns closer or watch the grid readjust itself as its dimensions are changed.

### Auto-Click

Users may choose to enable the Auto-Click feature of JGrid, which activates a random box within the grid in a set interval calculated to ensure that no box is clicked if another box has been already activated by this feature.
